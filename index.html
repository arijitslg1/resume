                    I was the instructor for O'Reilly's first Docker offering, an "Introduction to Docker" video tutorial, released in December 2014. This two-hour crash course takes students from "Hello Docker" to a complete workflow deploying a Dockerized application to the cloud.

                    MAYDAY is a "super PAC to end all super PACs" dedicated to campaign finance reform. I joined MAYDAY's volunteer tech team in January to architect and help implement the next iteration of their platform. By applying DevOps best practices and picking the right tools for the job, we debuted the new site at SXSW without a hitch.
